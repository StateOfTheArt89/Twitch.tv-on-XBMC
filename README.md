Twitch.tv on XBMC (Kodi)
==================

Watch your favorite gaming streams on XBMC (Kodi).

FAQ
----------------

* I can't find the Twitch.tv add-on in the xbmc add-on manager!

> Make sure you are using at least XBMC 12 Frodo / XBMC 13 Gotham / Kodi 14 Helix.

* I'm having issues with the playback of streams (buffering, dropping, stuttering).

> This Addon does not handle any aspect of the playback of Twitch streams (that would be the XBMC Video Player), it simply tells XBMC what to play.
> The Addon does however provide Quality Options which may help if your internet connection / computer specs are below requirements for HD streams.


What's next?
----------------

Things that need to be done next:

* Implement a user authentication
* Automated testing (unit tests)
* Code cleanup
